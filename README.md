# Implementation-of-APB-protocol

* The Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) is one of the components of the AMBA bus architecture.
* APB is known to have low bandwidth and a low performance bus is used 
  to connect the peripherals like UART, Timer and some other peripheral devices to the bus architecture. 
* The APB protocol is not pipelined. The APB protocol relates a signal transition to the rising edge of the clock 
   to signify the integration of APB peripherals into any design flow.
*The design is created using Verilog and is tested using Verilog test bench
